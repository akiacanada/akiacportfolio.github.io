# 👋 About

**Hi, I’m Akia Canada — a Data Science Master’s student passionate about building AI solutions that solve real-world problems.**

With a background in analytics and a deep interest in emerging technologies like natural language processing and cloud computing, I specialize in transforming data into intelligent tools. My most recent project, *SmartChat*, demonstrates how deep learning can make chatbots more useful by tailoring them to specific industries.

Whether I’m training models, analyzing data, or experimenting with new tools, I bring curiosity, creativity, and a drive to make tech more human-centered.
